exclusions: 
submitting a duplicate of someone else's find will not get you paid. 
Submitting text you encrypt with krypton or any other encryption or hash method and decrypting it does not count. 
putting the word crack, hack, cracked, cracked cipher in the cipher and sending it in does not count.

Rules: 
the only thing that counts is obtaining the text behind the cipher I've supplied and providing the proof of concept on how you did so. 
Good luck :)
