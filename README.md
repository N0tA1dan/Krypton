## CRACKME.txt

CRACKME.txt is a file containing a encrypted string from the Krypton encryption algorithm.

This is a bug bounty designed for people to try and crack Kryptons algorithm and extract the string from the encrypted text.

There are no limits on what you use to crack it.

from 06/13/2021 to 07/13/2021 we will pay $100 to whoever cracks it.

After the dead line you can still attempt to crack Krypton but we will no longer offer the money.

Sincerely, NotAidan.
